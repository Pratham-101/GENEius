Patients with the TT genotype had a significantly shorter median overall survival time (6.3 months) as compared to those with the GG or GT genotype (21.3 months). They also had a trend toward worse median progression-free survival time (3.5 months vs 7.9 months, HR=2.05 (0.96-4.39), p=0.065). In multivariate analysis, which included clinical parameters, this association with overall survival remained significant (p=0.012). Additionally, in a control cohort of patients ONLY on chemotherapy (no bevacizumab), there was no association between this variant and survival time, suggesting a predictive value for bevacizumab. Lastly, those with the TT genotype also had a lower clinical benefit rate (29%) as compared to those with the GG or GT genotype (70%, p=0.032).

A female patient with breast cancer was treated with tamoxifen, 3-amino-1-hydroprolylildene bisphosphonate and 5-fluorouracil. She developed severe toxicity in 2 weeks of treatment, and 5-fluorouracil treatment was stopped. Toxicity was diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, leukopenia. Analysis of DPD cDNA showed heterozygosity for a 165bp deletion that results from exon skipping. Sequence analysis of the genomic region encompassing the skipped exon showed that the patient was heterozygous for a G to A point mutation in the invariant GT splice donor sequence in the intron downstream of the skipped exon. This variant is now referred to as DPYD*2A. DPD activity in leukocytes (3.1 nmol/mg/h) was decreased compared to mean activity of DPD in controls (9.6+/-3.7), and comparable to that observed for obligate heterozygotes.	fluorouracil

Toxicity	false	This is described as a trend, and one that is in the opposite direction to findings of another prospective randomized clinical trial (MA27).  The SNP associated is ambiguous because of the G/C issue.  The association with decreased likelihood of toxicity is reported to be with G.  TCL1A is on the negative chromosomal strand.  Though this SNP is outside the gene, it is discussed as being near the gene, so I am guessing that the allele associated (with decreased toxicity) on the positive chromosomal strand is C.	exemestane

Candidate SNPs were then analyzed in three validation datasets (Stage II: iCOGS, SUCCESS-A, POSH). Those SNPs which remained statistically significant were further examined in an eQTL analysis of two breast cancer data sets (TCGA, METABRIC) in silico genomic analysis. After finding that the SNP was associated with survival in breast cancer patients, the authors tested the SNP for interaction with chemotherapy treatment in multivariate Cox proportional hazards adjusting for ER (+/-), tumor size, and nodal metastasis but only in the iCOG cohort.	anthracyclines and related substances

Candidate SNPs were then analyzed in three validation datasets (Stage II: iCOGS, SUCCESS-A, POSH). Those SNPs which remained statistically significant were further examined in an eQTL analysis of two breast cancer data sets (TCGA, METABRIC) in silico genomic analysis. This SNP had the opposite effect (a HR greater than 1 in the discovery cohort and an HR smaller than 1 in the validation cohort).	antineoplastic agents
