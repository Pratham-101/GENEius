1183693517	rs3832043	PMID:22527346	UGT1A9	Allele del is not associated with risk of COMT inhibitor-induced toxicity due to entacapone or tolcapone in people with Parkinson Disease as compared to allele T.	no		63		Unknown	Toxicity	false	No association was found between this SNP alone and risk of toxicity from treatment with COMT inhibitors entacapone or tolcapone. However, when combined with rs72551330, patients with low UGT1A9 activity showed significantly increased risk of developing toxicity as compared to patients with intermediate or high activity of UGT1A9 (OR: 9.33, P=.014). Activity of UGT1A9 was determined by the presence of variant alleles as follows: the variant allele of rs72551330 was assigned the value of -1, while the variant at this SNP was assigned the value of +1. Both wildtype alleles were assigned the value of 0. Patients with a total negative value were considered to have low activity, patients with a total positive value were considered to have high activity, and patients with a total of 0 were considered to have intermediate activity. Example: a patient heterozygous at both SNPs would have a total score of 0 due to the -1 from rs72551330 and the +1 from this SNP, classifying them as a patient with intermediate activity.	entacapone; tolcapone
