Patients homozygous for the II genotype showed a much greater benefit (a significantly lower increase in albumin excretion ratio) from treatment with lisinopril as compared to patients carrying the D allele.	lisinopril
1183943974	rs72554665	PMID:21147013	G6PD	Allele A (assigned as deficiency phenotype) is associated with Hemolysis when treated with insulin recombinant in men with Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1.	not stated		1		East Asian	Other	false	Hemolysis occurred after admission for a hyperglycemic state, which may result in further G6PD deficiency. The hemolysis was not necessarily attributed to insulin treatment. This patient had mild episodes of hemolysis during a 2 year follow up, and he reported episodes of jaundice and anemia as an infant therefore the underlying variant may cause sporadic hemolytic episodes.	insulin recombinant
