1451503940	rs2076295	PMCID:PMC8442489	DSP	Genotype TT is associated with decreased overall survival when treated with nintedanib in people with Pulmonary Fibrosis as compared to genotypes GG + GT.	yes	= 0.004	40		European	Efficacy	false	since there was no difference in OS between genotypes in the pirfenidone group, patients with TT genotype of rs2076295 had signiifcantly better OS with pirfenidone than with nintedanib treatment.	nintedanib

Efficacy	false	"""The TOLLIP rs5743890 risk allele was significantly associated with improved survival, with increasing pirfenidone duration, for CC or CT genotype carriers but not for those with the TT genotype"""	pirfenidone

Alleles given on reverse strand A and G.	acetylcysteine
1447982696	rs5743854	PMCID:PMC4731723	TOLLIP	Genotype CC is not associated with response to acetylcysteine in people with Pulmonary Fibrosis as compared to genotypes CG + GG.	no	= 0.03	60		European	Efficacy	false	Clinical endpoints included death, transplant, hospitalization, or FVC decline,  and risk was adjusted for age, sex, prednisone use, azathioprine use, FVC, diffusion capacity of the lung, and trial/center.

Gastrointestinal ADRs were the most frequent"""	pirfenidone
